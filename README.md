# Welcome to the OpenEAC Alliance Methodology Repository

This is the homepage for the current versions of the methodologies that allow WattCarbon to create EACs for clean energy resources. Each methodology category is contained in a separate folder.

The [OpenEAC Alliance](https://www.openeac.org/) is a volunteer organization comprised of individuals and organizations with experience developing measurement and verification techniques. Each methodology is reviewed by members of the OpenEAC Alliance and each change to an approved methodology will require notification of all reviewers.

For meeting updates and up-to-date communication, see our [substack](https://www.openeac.org/).

### Submission
Individual methodologies are added by Request ([step-by-step guide](https://github.com/wattcarbon/open-eac-alliance/blob/main/how-to-submit.md)). The methodology file should be added to the repo under the following naming structure: `methodologies/{category}/{methodology_title_snake_case}.md`.

### Approval Process

The approval process proceeds in several steps:

1. A Request is submitted to the OpenEAC Alliance with a new methodology.
2. The Request is reviewed by the maintainers and added to the queue for presentation at an OpenEAC Alliance meeting.
3. The authors present the methodology to the OpenEAC Alliance.
4. The authors update the methodology based on feedback.
5. Final Approval requires at least 3 reviewers must approve the methodology Request.
