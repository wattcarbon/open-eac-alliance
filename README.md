# Welcome to the OpenEAC Alliance Methodology Repository


This is the homepage for the current versions of the methodologies that allow WattCarbon to create EACs for clean energy resources. Each methodology category is contained in a separate folder.

The [OpenEAC Alliance](https://www.openeac.org/) is a volunteer organization comprised of individuals and organizations with experience developing measurement and verification techniques. Each methodology is reviewed by members of the OpenEAC Alliance and each change to an approved methodology will require notification of all reviewers.

For meeting updates and up-to-date communication, see our [substack](https://www.openeac.org/).
