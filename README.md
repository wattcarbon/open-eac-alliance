# Welcome to the OpenEAC Alliance Methodology Repository

The [OpenEAC Alliance](https://www.openeac.org/) is a volunteer organization comprised of individuals and organizations with experience developing measurement and verification techniques. Each methodology is reviewed by members of the OpenEAC Alliance and each change to an approved methodology will require notification of all reviewers.

For meeting updates and up-to-date communication, see our [substack](https://www.openeac.org/).

For a list of our methodologies and their statuses, go to [this page](https://methods.openeac.org).

For a link to the github page storing this work, go to [this page](https://github.com/wattcarbon/open-eac-alliance).

The listed methodologies have been used for Measurement and Verification of a variety of grid interventions, such as battery storage installation, electrification, demand response, and energy efficiency projects.

### Submission
Individual methodologies are added by Request. New methodologies are initially written in a google doc that allows for public comment. The link is then be shared with one of the OpenEAC Alliance maintainers (such as [mcgee@wattcarbon.com](mcgee@wattcarbon.com)) so that it can be added to the list of methodologies.

### Approval Process

The approval process proceeds in several steps:

1. A draft methodology is published for implementation by one or more stakeholders (using google docs with public comment permission).
2. This document is shared with the OpeneEAC Alliance maintainers to be posted onto [methods.openeac.org](https://methods.openeac.org)
3. A minimum 30-day public comment period is opened.
4. After the comment period is closed, the authors update the methodology based on feedback.
5. A final version is published as a PDF copy, which is added to the `approved_documents` section of the repository along with that document's public comment history.


### Glossary

- EAC (Energy Attribute Certificate): represents a unique claim to the environmental benefits of a decarbonization project. EACs are granular certificates assigned to a watt-hour of energy or a gram of CO2e that specify all attributes of the underlying energy resource, including Asset type, production time, precise location, local grid carbon emissions intensity, resource operation start date, and reporting requirements.
- Asset: describies the energy intervention that results in EACs, such as a solar panel system, battery, demand response event, or building that underwent an energy efficiency upgrade. An Asset exists at a point of metered interconnection between a production or consumption Asset and a network of other Assets that share a common and bounded electricity grid where all imports or exports of electricity to this grid are metered.
- Meter: The source of measured data used to calculate the impact of the Asset.

We also have written up a general document that includes guidelines to be applied to all methodologies and can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gRlbUPxR4HVqd1OVVaGlLClKK4-HmmhPs-457_GRZqs/view)
