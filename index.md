### Submission
Individual methodologies are added by Request. New methodologies should be in a google doc that allows for public comment. The link should then be shared with one of the OpenEAC Alliance maintainers (such as [mcgee@wattcarbon.com](mcgee@wattcarbon.com)) so that it can be added to the table above.

### Approval Process

The approval process proceeds in several steps:

1. A Request is submitted to the OpenEAC Alliance with a new methodology.
2. The Request is reviewed by the maintainers and added to the queue for presentation at an OpenEAC Alliance meeting.
3. The authors present the methodology to the OpenEAC Alliance.
4. The authors update the methodology based on feedback.
5. Final Approval requires at least 3 reviewers must approve the methodology Request.
